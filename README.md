# Automated-Dustbin
Arduino-based dusting system with HC-SR04 sensor. Detects dust, triggers cleaning with microfiber brushes/air jets via Arduino Uno. Revolutionizes cleaning with efficiency, versatility for homes, businesses. Compact, customizable design ensures thorough cleaning in tight spaces. Experience the future of cleanliness!

Trigger Pin: When the Arduino sends a short pulse (usually 10 microseconds) to the trigger pin, it initiates the measurement process. This pulse acts as a signal to the sensor to start emitting ultrasonic waves.

Ultrasonic Wave Emission: Once triggered, the sensor emits a burst of ultrasonic waves. These waves travel through the air until they encounter an obstacle in their path.

Obstacle Detection: When the ultrasonic waves hit an object in front of the sensor, they are reflected back towards the sensor.

Echo Pin: The sensor has a receiver built-in that can detect these reflected waves. The time it takes for the waves to travel from the sensor to the object and back again is measured. This duration is directly proportional to the distance between the sensor and the object.

Calculation of Distance: Using the known speed of sound in air (approximately 343 meters per second at room temperature), the Arduino calculates the distance to the object based on the time it took for the ultrasonic waves to travel and return.

Data Interpretation: The Arduino then processes this information and can perform various actions based on the calculated distance. For example, it can activate motors to avoid obstacles in a robotic vehicle, adjust the position of a servo motor, or trigger a cleaning mechanism in an automated dusting system.

By continuously sending out pulses, receiving echoes, and calculating distances, the ultrasonic sensor provides real-time information about the surroundings, enabling precise control and decision-making in a wide range of applications.
